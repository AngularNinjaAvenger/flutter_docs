    "description": "In this example, the children are spaced out equally, unless there's no more\nroom, in which case they stack vertically and scroll.\n\nWhen using this technique, [Expanded] and [Flexible] are not useful, because\nin both cases the \"available space\" is infinite (since this is in a viewport).\nThe next section describes a technique for providing a maximum height constraint."
